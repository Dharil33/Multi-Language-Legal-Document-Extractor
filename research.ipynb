The facts necessary for deciding the question involved in the case are that one Maganlal', 'Jain was\\\\nthe original tenant of Prakash Chand Malviya, the respondent- landlord. Maganlal Jain had given\\\\nthe shop to the appellant for carrying out the business. On a dispute being arisen between', 'the\\\\nrespondent-landlord, the original tenant Maganlal Jain and the appellant herein, an agreement was\\\\nexecuted on 28.3.1988 by the respondent (landlord) and the appellant (subsequent tenant),', 'whereby\\\\nthe landlord tenanted the shop to the appellant on payment of an advance amount of Rs.4,75,000/-\\\\nwhich was received by the landlord in cash in front of the witnesses. The agreement further', 'provided\\\\nthat in case the landlord requires eviction of the tenant from the shop he will have to give notice of 6\\\\nmonths to the tenant and will also refund the payment of Rs.4,75,000/- to the', 'tenant. On the other\\\\nhand, if the tenant wants to vacate the shop he will have to give prior notice of 6 months to the\\\\nlandlord and the landlord will pay back Rs.4,75,000/- to the tenant. This', 'document was affixed with\\\\na notarial stamp of Rs.4/-. Under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (for short □the Act□), agreement of\\\\nthis nature requires affixture of a stamp of Re.1/- under Schedule I, Item', '42 of the said Act.\\\\n3. On 12.5.2003 a suit for eviction was filed by the respondent-landlord before the Civil Judge,\\\\nBhopal under Section 12(1)(f) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act,', 'stating the\\\\nbonafide need for the use of the accommodation by his elder son. It was the case of the\\\\nappellant-tenant that the original copy of the agreement which was with him was stolen and thus', 'he\\\\nwas unable to produce the original document dated 28.3.1988, but was in possession of a photostat\\\\ncopy of the agreement and made a prayer for receipt of the photocopy of the agreement as', 'secondary\\\\nevidence under Section 63 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

On being aggrieved by the order of the trial court, the respondent-landlord filed a writ petition\\\\nbefore the High Court. The High Court set aside\", 'the order of the trial court and remitted the matter\\\\nback to decide the question as to whether a photocopy of an improperly stamped original document\\\\ncan be received in secondary evidence. After', 'hearing the parties, the trial court by its order dated\\\\n9.8.2005 ordered that the document be impounded, it being insufficiently stamped; the document\\\\nwas sent to the Collector of Stamps for', 'affixing appropriate stamp duty and thereafter for sending\\\\nthe document back to the court. This order was challenged by the respondent in a review petition\\\\nwhich was dismissed by the trial court.', 'Thereafter, a writ petition was filed before the High Court.\\\\nThe High Court by its judgment dated 3.5.2006 held that the impugned document which is a\\\\nphotocopy of the agreement, original of which', 'is lost, cannot be admitted in evidence; and that such\\\\na document can neither be impounded nor can be accepted in secondary evidence.\\\\n5. It is an admitted fact that the photostat copy which is', 'sought to be produced as secondary\\\\nevidence does not show that on the original agreement proper stamp duty was paid. The photostat\\\\ncopy of the agreement shows that the original agreement carried', 'only a notarial stamp of Rs.4/-.\\\\nThus the original instrument bears the stamp of sufficient amount but of improper description.\\\\nFrom the facts of the case, the issue which requires consideration', 'is: Whether the court can\\\\nimpound the photocopy of the instrument (document) of improper description exercising its power\\\\nunder the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899?. For answering this', 'question, Sections 33 and\\\\n35 of the Act might render some help. Relevant extracts of the Sections are :\\\\n›3. Examination and impounding of instruments □ (1) Every person by law or consent of', 'parties,\\\\nauthority to receive evidence, and every person in charge of a public office, except an officer of\\\\npolice, before whom any instrument, chargeable, in his opinion, with duty, is produced or', 'comes in\\\\nthe performance of his functions, shall, if it appears to him that such instrument is not duly\\\\nstamped, impound the same.\\\\n(2) For that purpose every such person shall examine every', 'instrument so chargeable and so\\\\nproduced or coming before him, in order to ascertain whether it is stamped with a stamp of the\\\\nvalue and description required by the law in force in(India) when such', 'instrument was executed or\\\\nfirst executed:\\\\n□ □ □□ ›5. Instruments not duly stamped inadmissible in evidence, etc. - No instrument chargeable\\\\nwith duty shall be admitted in evidence for any person', 'having by law or consent of parties to receive\\\\nevidence, or shall be acted upon, registered or authenticated by any such person or by any public\\\\nofficer, unless such instrument is duly stamped:\\\\n□', '□ □□\\\\n6. Section 33 gives power to the authority to check whether the instrument has been duly stamped\\\\nand in case it is not duly stamped, to take steps to impound the same by proper stamp duty on', 'the\\\\nsaid document.

It is next contended that as the copy of the award in court was unstamped, no decree could have\\\\nbeen passed thereon. The facts are that the', 'arbitrator sent to each of the parties a copy of the award\\\\nsigned by him and a third copy also signed by him was sent to the court. The copy of the award\\\\nwhich was sent to the Government would', 'appear to have been insufficiently stamped. If that had\\\\nbeen produced in court, it could have been validated on payment of the deficiency and penalty under\\\\nS.35 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. But', 'the Government has failed to produce the same. The copy of\\\\nthe award which was sent to the respondents is said to have been seized by the police along with\\\\nother papers and is not now available.', 'When the third copy was received in court, the respondents\\\\npaid the requisite stamp duty under S.35 of the Stamp Act and had it validated. Now the contention\\\\nof the appellant is that the instrument', 'actually before the court is, what it purports to be, □a certified\\\\ncopy□, and that under S.35 of the Stamp Act there can be validation only of the original, when it is\\\\nunstamped or insufficiently', 'stamped, that the document in court which is a copy cannot be validated\\\\nand □acted upon□ and that in consequence no decree could be passed thereon. The law is no doubt\\\\nwell- settled that the copy', 'of an instrument cannot be validated. That was held in Rajah of Bobbili v.\\\\nInuganti China Sitaramasami Garu, 26 Ind App 262, where it was observed :\\\\n□The provisions of this section (section 35)', 'which allow a document to be admitted in evidence on\\\\npayment of penalty, have no application when the original document, which was unstamped or was\\\\ninsufficiently stamped, has not been produced;', 'and, accordingly, secondary evidence of its contents\\\\ncannot be given.

If Section 35 only deals with original instruments and not', 'copies Section 36 cannot be so\\\\ninterpreted as to allow secondary evidence of an instrument to have its benefit. The words □an\\\\ninstrument□ in Section 36 must have the same meaning as that in Section', '35. The legislature only\\\\nrelented from the strict provisions of Section 35 in cases where the original instrument was admitted\\\\nin evidence without objection at the initial stage of a suit or', 'proceeding. In other words, although the\\\\nobjection is based on the insufficiency of the stamp affixed to the document, a party who has a right\\\\nto object to the reception of it must do so when the', 'document is first tendered.
